      <p>
        The Hungarian Spirit Award is given to students in recognition for achievement in the face of adversity.
        Each year, the named honoree is rotated among great Hungarian immigrants submitted by the community.
        Finalists embody the life and values of Hungarian refugees by demonstrating their commitment
        to community or family service. As with all Bardos Foundation grants,
        immigration history and financial need play a central role in awards.

      <p>
        This year's Hungarian Spirit Award honoree is <a class="underline text-blue-700" href="https://www.newbaker.com/obituaries/Laszlo-Herczku?obId=37787284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laszlo Herczku</a>.
        Laszlo was a resilient soul whose life journey spanned continents.
        Born in Budapest and trained as a shoemaker, he escaped revolutionary turmoil to embrace freedom in the US.
        A proud Army veteran and devoted General Motors employee, Laszlo built a life defined by
        hard work and quiet brilliance. A passionate lover of boxing, soccer, and Hungary, he
        reveled in life's simple pleasures and cherished his family. Ever meticulous and
        warm—his charming "Hunglish" conversations brightened every gathering—Laszlo's legacy
        of determination and kindness endures in this year's Hungarian Spirit Award.
