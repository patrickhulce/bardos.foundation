      <p>
        The Bardos Foundation awards multiple grants annually to first-generation and
        second-generation immigrant students for their academic and community achievements.
        Winners demonstrate their academic rigor, financial need, and outstanding community or
        family involvement. There are two named awards: the Agota M. Bardos grant for the arts
        and the Denes I. Bardos grant for science and engineering.
