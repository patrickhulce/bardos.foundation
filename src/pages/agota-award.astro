      <p>
        The Agota M. Bardos Award is given to students in recognition for achievement in their
        community and the arts. Finalists embody the life and values of Agota Bardos by
        demonstrating their commitment to visual arts or music, academic rigor, and community or
        family service. As with all Bardos Foundation grants, immigration history and financial
        need play a central role in awards.

      <p>
        Agota (Agi) Bardos was a woman of active faith and fearless conviction. Bright,
        disciplined, hardworking, organized, and outspoken, she always thought of others first.
        Agi not only raised ten children but she also opened her heart and home to many who
        needed it. A devout Catholic and a Secular Franciscan, she was a very nurturing, holy,
        and loving example to everyone she encountered. Agi loved to garden, sew, paint, knit,
        crochet, pray, sing, and play the piano. An excellent cook, and ahead of her time, she
        must have made tens of thousands of healthy meals for her large family. She passed away
        from cancer in January of 2007.
